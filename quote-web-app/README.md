# Quote web-app
### What is it?
Goal of this web app is to provide a system that displays quotes after a button tap.
After you tap a button, you see a quote. Then you can tap the button again, and a new quote will appear.

### Why would you use it?
We made this app for entertainment for people who have a lot of time.
So if you have a lot of free time, you will be pleased with nice quotes.
